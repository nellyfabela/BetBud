# Bet Bud - A friendly betting platform 

## Description

Bet Bud is a social network platform aimed at friendly betting. The idea is that people join this platform and can, as in a social network, interact with other users to place bets on a particular event. The prizes of the bets to win are: a meal, a drink, some movie tickets or cash.

The user must register on the platform, have access to it, invite and connect with friends, and place bets among their friends.
We decided to build this project as we believe that the social networks tend to be more specialized to certain subjects, as for example, there are networks for pictures, for news, for jobs, etc. So then we think that there is a market in which sport betting as social network can be a great project to develop.

We learned as a team that no matter how much we know, we need to be very communicative and work as one. Any type of change can affect the whole plan, the application and the work done. It is important to iterate all of the activities and work we do to make the proejct work, only by repeating and debugging is that we learn how to master the work.

## Installation

For installation we worked with HTML, Talwind, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, Handlebars, MySQL, bcrypt and Sequilize. These were taught during class and made the project easier to be worked on. There were many testing included in order to make sure that the application worked the way we envisioned.

## Usage

As usage the application consists on having a user to enter as an user (login) or a new user (signup). After having the information and entering the dashboard the bets can start!

The user can invite their buds to bet depending on what they want as well as know how they're doing, if they lost or won bets.
